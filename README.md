# Wonderland (Olympus Pro fork) - Atomic Bonding
A tool for purchasing and redeeming Wonderland bonds atomically.
Note: Wonderland bonding is currently disabled.

## Background
### Purchasing bond
1. Swap $TIME To $MIM
2. Bond $TIME With $MIM

### Redeeming bond
1. Redeem $TIME / Staked $TIME

## Issue
1. Exposure to high slippage / price action in 2 transactions (purchase bond).
2. Inability to purchase bond at optimal prices without constant pair & bond price monitoring.

## Solution
1. Purchase bond: Atomic / in one transaction.
2. Automated pair & bond price monitoring. Price from on-chain trade pair, slippage & fees inclusive.
3. Redeem bond: Safe to invoke from untrusted accounts.
